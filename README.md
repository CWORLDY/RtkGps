#### Android features:

* Bluetooth communication
* USB OTG communication with speed/parity/stop configuration (ACM, PL2303 chips and alpha for FTDI chips)
* SiRF IV protocol (experimental)
* Show altitude in status view if Height/Geodetic is choosen
* Send mock location to other applications if the checkbox is ticked in the solution option screen. (Not working yet with apps using Google Maps api)
* Upload Log/Solution to Dropbox if Sync to Dropbox is ticked in the FileSettings screen. (the sync occurs after the stop of the server)
* Ability to zip files before uploading to Dropbox for reducing the data volume.
* Generate a GPX track (Output view/GPX Track tab)
* Show UTM coordinates in solution view
* Support for french Geoportail maps (cadastral parcels, roads and satellite) - needs api license key see src/gpsplus/rtkgps/geoportail/License.java.sample 

#### Geoids
* you can select different geoid model in "Solution Option"/Geoid model but except for embedded model (EGM96 1째x1째)  
  you will need to place the corresponding model in the RtkGps storage (probably /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps)  
  the model format is RTKLIB dependent, check jni/RTKLIB/src/geoid.c  
  the model file MUST be one of:  
  ```
    EGM96_M150.geoid  
    EGM2008_M25.geoid  
    EGM2008_M10.geoid  
    GSI2000_M15.geoid
    RAF09_M15x20.geoid  
  ``` 
  
  for example if you want to use EGM2008 2.5'x2.5' model you need:
  ```
    1.  download from National Geospatial Intelligence Agency the model  
  			  on august 2014 file can be found http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/Small_Endian/Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree_SE.gz   
    2.  extract the Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree_SE file and rename it EGM2008_M25.geoid (149Mo)   
    3.  place this model in RtkGps storage path (where all the trace and log go), on my tools it is /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps/
  ```

  for example if you want to use IGN RAF09 1.5'x2.5' model you need:
  ```
    1.  download from IGN wich is the french national geographical institute the model  
  			  on august 2014 file can be found http://geodesie.ign.fr/contenu/fichiers/documentation/grilles/metropole/RAF09.mnt   
    2.  rename it RAF09_M15x20.geoid    
    3.  place this model in RtkGps storage path (where all the trace and log go), on my tools it is /storage/sdcard0/RtkGps/
  ```
   
  if you do not have the correct model or if model is inconsistent it will not show an error, rather than it will use the EGM96 1째x1째 embedded model or it use ellipsoidal height.
